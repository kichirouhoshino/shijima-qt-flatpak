## Flatpak package for [shijima-qt](https://getshijima.app/) by pixelomer
To build and install:
`$ flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean builddir app.getshijima.shijima-qt`
Make sure you have org.Kde.Platform and org.kde.Sdk version 6.8 installed

Since this app is proprietary, no files from the release binaries are contained in this repo. I will also not provide flatpak bundles. Only the flatpak manifest is provided. Please build it yourself.
